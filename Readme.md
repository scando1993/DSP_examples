# This is a repository for giving some aditional examples of DSP in matlab
 
 The distribution of the folders is the following:
 * Examples 1 	-> 	In here you can see some implementations of my own implementation
 					of convolution also correlation and an implementation of a eco generation
 					system.

 * Examples 2	->	In here you can find my own implement the DFT algorithm also there's a script
 					that allows you to read a wav music file and show the frecuency analysis.

 * Examples 3	->	Here is a script for a generate a plot showing a spectogram plot.

 * Examples 4	->	Implemention of moving average filter and also a script for making a karaoke from a wav
 					file.

 * Examples 5	->	Here is a script for making an equalizer from diferent frecuencies, this was implemented
 					using a customized filter.
